ADR-03 — Implement Multi-Tenancy Using a Shared Schema + tenant_id
Status: Accepted
Context
The CMS must support multiple organisations (tenants) with strict data isolation.
Decision
Use one shared schema and include a tenant_id field in all tenant-scoped tables (complaints, users, audit_logs).
Rationale
•	Easiest approach with Django ORM.
•	Avoids maintaining multiple schemas/databases.
•	Improves performance through shared connection pooling.
Consequences
Positive: Simple, scalable, minimal operational overhead.
Negative: Requires rigorous tenant_id filtering in all queries.
