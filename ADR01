ADR-01 — Adopt Django as the Primary Web Framework
Status: Accepted
Context
The CMS requires secure authentication, structured complaint workflows, built-in admin tools, and rapid development.
Decision
Use Django as the main web framework, supplemented by Django REST Framework (DRF) for API endpoints.
Rationale
•	Batteries-included framework (ORM, auth, routing, templates, forms).
•	Strong security defaults (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection protection).
•	Excellent for structured, relational systems such as complaint records.
•	Minimal boilerplate compared to Flask.
Consequences
Positive: Rapid prototyping, clean structure, secure-by-default.
Negative: More opinionated than micro-frameworks.
