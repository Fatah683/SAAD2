ADR-04 — Apply a Layered Architecture (Views → Services → Repository/ORM)
Status: Accepted
Context
Complaint workflows, permission logic, and tenant isolation must be consistent across all interfaces.
Decision
Use a layered backend structure:
•	Views / API Views → process HTTP requests
•	Service Layer → business logic (ComplaintService, UserService, TenantService)
•	Repository Layer → Django ORM models
Rationale
•	Ensures reusability and maintainability.
•	Keeps views/controllers thin.
•	Supports unit testing of core business logic.
Consequences
Positive: Modular, clean, extensible architecture.
Negative: Slight increase in boilerplate code.
