ADR-07 — Implement Security Using Django Middleware + RBAC
Status: Accepted
Context
The CMS manages personal information and must meet organisational governance standards.
Decision
Use:
•	Django’s built-in Auth system
•	Role-based access control (RBAC)
•	Security middleware (CSRF, XSS, clickjacking, secure cookies)
Rationale
•	Django’s auth framework is battle-tested.
•	Middleware provides layered protection.
•	Roles map directly to CMS responsibilities (consumer, agent, support staff, manager, admin).
Consequences
Positive: Strong baseline security.
Negative: Custom granular permissions may require additional code.
