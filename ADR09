ADR-09 — Integrate Email Notifications Using Django’s Email Backend
Status: Accepted
Context
Users must receive updates when complaints are submitted or updated.
Decision
Use Django’s Email Backend (console backend for POC; SMTP for production).
Rationale
•	Integrated into Django.
•	Easy to mock for testing.
•	Supports asynchronous enhancements later.
Consequences
Positive: Simple communication integration.
Negative: True asynchronous behaviour may require Celery in a future phase.
